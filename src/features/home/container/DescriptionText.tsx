      <span className="gradient font-extrabold">Misc is an art collection of 20 unique surreal avatars created by Adeleye
      Temiloluwa that live on the Firebase blockchain. </span>‍ Avatars are the
      foundation of all life on the digital system, upon which machines and
      every other electronic creature depends. Ecosystems thrive with a
      diversity of avatars that form complex communities, who both depend on and
      compete with one another in a natural symbiosis. ‍ NFTs, the end product
      of many plants, attract humans with their alluring colours, nice fonts and
      amazing message. Yet they bloom only briefly, and only under the right
      conditions, making NFTs an expensive resource for an Avatar to produce. ‍
      It is my wish that these Avatars inspire us to look for guidance in the
      infinitely beautiful and intelligent digital world.
